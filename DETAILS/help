Project folder must exist in D drive as D:/Database in C with API
(modify functions.h to change it's value)


Minor issues may occur. Use at your own risk.Or you can modify the definition file FUNCTION_H

this project should be in D drive of computer . otherwise change the definition file FUNCTIONS_H for your location. Better to use D drive and keep this folder as it is.

Do not use or do anything to file under internals. They are used for easy functioning, tracking and for run time variables.



TYPE LOG to see the commands


contentVar defines the copy and paste content from the file.

files keep track of the created files in the form of name and id.

pointer was created to inject into run time variables and modify them but was not used in the project. How ever better to keep it in case needed.

main.C contains the main program where command is input and then passed to the main definition file FUNCTION_H for further execution after some front kits check

functions.h contains all the definition of executable functions and how commands are working. It is the main logic of the whole system. Can be modified according to the need.

main.exe is the binary executable for the system


-------working-------
all files are create in data folder . No nested folders can exist. can cause errors.

create file creates a file as a child of data folder and stores the metadata into internals/files
everything is then accessed accordingly....

you can import file using the import command which takes your new filename and id as parameter
